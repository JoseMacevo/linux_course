1. The file system tree begins in what is often called the root(**or trunk, or /**)
   directory.
2. The File System Hierarchy Standard (FHS) privides Linux devs and system
   administrators with
   a standard directory structure for the file system.
3. The partitions help segregate files based on *usage*, *ownership* and *type*.
4. The Filesystems an be mounted anywhere in the main filesystem tree at a mount
   point. Automatic
   mounting of the file system can be configured by editing **/etc/fstab**.
5. NTFS (Network File System) is a useful method for sharing files and data
   across network systems.
6. File systems like **/proc** are called pseudo filesystems because they only
   exist in memory.
7. **/root** (slash root) is the root user's home directory.
8. **/var** can be placed in its own filesystem so that it can contain the  
   growth and not fatally affect to the system.
9. **/boot** contains the basic files necessary to boot the system.
10. **patch** is a very useful tool in Linux. Many source code modifications and
    configuration files are distributed with patch files because they contain the
    deltas or changes to move from an older version of a file to the new version
    of a file.
11. The file extensions in Linux don't necessarily mean that a file is a certain
    type.
12. **cp** is used to copy files to the local computer, while rsync can also be used
    to copy files from one computer to another, as well as to synchronize content.
13. **gzip, bzip2, xz and zip** are used to compress files.
14. **tar** allow you to create or extract files from an archive file, often called
    **tarball**. Optonally, you can compress during file creation and decompress
    while extracting its contents.
15. **dd** can be used to make large exact copies of even entire disk partitions
    efficiently.
